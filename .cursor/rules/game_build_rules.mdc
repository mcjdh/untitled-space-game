# Game Build Rules

This rule outlines our approach to enhancing the game implemented in [space-game.py](mdc:space-game.py). The planned enhancements include:

- **Start Screen**: Display a title and instruction screen that waits for player input to begin the game.
- **Collision Detection**: Implement collision detection between the player's spaceship and enemies. Trigger a game over state (or reduce lives) when a collision occurs.
- **Game Over Screen**: Show a game over screen with the final score and an option to restart.
- **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for shooting, explosions, and collisions to enhance the retro game feel.
- **Additional Features**: Optionally incorporate power-ups, extra enemy types, and increasing difficulty over time.
